This incremental project intends to implement a discrete 2D Navier-Stokes model
in Kivy starting from 1D diffusion and working our way up. This is largely
following the steps outlined in [12 Steps to Navier Stokes](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/),
but with some simpler implementation due to convolutions.
